As part of my coursework, I recently worked on an assignment that required me to analyze a business problem and propose a tech solution using the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). The project was focused on Smart Inventory Management for Retail, where I explored how businesses can reduce overstocking and stockouts by leveraging data-driven decision-making. This experience helped me understand the key phases of SDLC, ROI calculations, and how to draft funding requests.

## **Understanding the Business Problem**

Retail businesses often struggle with inventory issues, leading to wasted stock and financial losses. Through this assignment, I explored the common causes of these issues:

* **Overstocking** – Excess perishable goods lead to waste and higher storage costs.
    
* **Stockouts** – Running out of essential items affects sales and customer satisfaction.
    
* **Inefficient Manual Tracking** – Without automation, inventory updates are slow and error-prone.
    

I learned that a key responsibility in business analysis is understanding business pain points before recommending solutions.

## **Applying the SDLC Process**

This assignment required me to map out the **SDLC phases** for implementing a Smart Inventory Management System (SIMS):

1. **Planning & Analysis** – Defining the problem, gathering requirements from stakeholders, and assessing feasibility.
    
2. **Design** – Outlining the system's architecture, including potential AI-driven forecasting and automation features.
    
3. **Development Considerations** – Understanding how databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB), cloud solutions (AWS), and machine learning tools (TensorFlow) might be used.
    
4. **Testing & Deployment Strategies** – Identifying how the system would be tested for accuracy and deployed across retail locations.
    
5. **Maintenance & Continuous Improvement** – Exploring how real-time monitoring and AI optimizations would support long-term efficiency.
    

This exercise helped me think like a business analyst, considering how a theoretical system could be designed before implementation.

## **Learning ROI Calculation & Funding Requests**

One of the most valuable aspects of this assignment was understanding how to **justify the cost of a business solution.** I learned how to:

* **Calculate ROI** – Estimating the financial impact of reduced waste, increased sales, and labor savings.
    
* **Draft a funding request** – Outlining the budget required for software, hardware, and training.
    
* **Perform a break-even analysis** – Determining how long it would take for cost savings to cover the investment.
    

For example, I calculated that reducing overstocking by 30%, increasing sales by 15%, and automating inventory tracking could lead to annual savings of $135,000. Understanding these financial aspects gave me insights into how businesses evaluate technology investments.

## **Key Business Analysis Skills I Gained**

**Understanding SDLC Phases** – Learning how structured methodologies guide system development.  
**Stakeholder Requirement Gathering** – Identifying business needs from different perspectives (store managers, suppliers, finance teams).  
**Process Analysis** – Exploring automation and AI to improve efficiency.  
**Financial Justification** – Learning to present ROI and funding requests for business decision-making.  
**Big-Picture Thinking** – Developing a structured approach to problem-solving in business analysis.

## **Final Thoughts**

This assignment gave me a strong theoretical foundation in business analysis, helping me understand how businesses approach tech-driven solutions. While I didn’t implement the system, I now have a clear understanding of how projects are planned, analyzed, and financially justified before development even begins.
